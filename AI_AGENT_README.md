# AI Agent Integration for MediTrack

This document explains how to use the AI Agent functionality that has been successfully converted from Deno to Node.js and integrated into the MediTrack application.

## üöÄ Overview

The AI Agent provides intelligent assistance for medication management, healthcare questions, and insights about your MediTrack data. It uses Anthropic's Claude AI model and supports optional web crawling capabilities.

## üìÅ Files Created

### Core AI Agent Service
- **`src/services/aiAgent.ts`** - Main AI Agent class with browser-compatible implementation
- **`src/pages/AIAssistant.tsx`** - React component for AI chat interface
- **`src/examples/aiAgentExample.ts`** - Example usage and demonstration code

### Configuration
- **`.env`** - Updated with AI Agent environment variables
- **`src/routes/AppRouter.tsx`** - Added AI Assistant route
- **`src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`** - Added AI Assistant to navigation menu

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
The following packages have been installed:
```bash
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk rxjs-for-await rxjs
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Update your `.env` file with your API keys:

```env
# AI Agent Configuration
# Add your Anthropic API key here (VITE_ prefix makes it available in browser)
VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_anthropic_api_key_here

# Add your Firecrawl API key here (optional - for web crawling capabilities)
VITE_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_actual_firecrawl_api_key_here
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use `VITE_` prefix for environment variables to make them available in the browser
- Replace `your_actual_anthropic_api_key_here` with your real API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- Firecrawl API key is optional but enables web crawling features

### 3. Get API Keys

#### Anthropic API Key (Required)
1. Visit [https://console.anthropic.com/](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy and paste it into your `.env` file

#### Firecrawl API Key (Optional)
1. Visit [https://firecrawl.dev/](https://firecrawl.dev/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Add it to your `.env` file

## üéØ Usage

### Accessing the AI Assistant
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the AI Assistant page via the sidebar menu
3. Start chatting with the AI about medication management topics

### Available Features

#### 1. Basic AI Assistance
- Ask questions about medication management
- Get healthcare insights and best practices
- Receive guidance on inventory management

#### 2. Suggested Questions
The interface provides helpful starter questions:
- "How can I improve medication adherence?"
- "What are best practices for medication inventory management?"
- "Explain the importance of proper medication storage"
- "How do I set up medication reminders effectively?"
- "What should I know about drug interactions?"

#### 3. Real-time Streaming
- Responses stream in real-time for better user experience
- Visual indicators show AI thinking, tool usage, and completion status

### Programmatic Usage

#### Basic Example
```typescript
import { AIAgent } from '../services/aiAgent';
import { eachValueFrom } from 'rxjs-for-await';

const agent = new AIAgent();
await agent.init();

const event$ = agent.runTask('How can I improve medication adherence?');

for await (const event of eachValueFrom(event$)) {
  console.log(`[${event.type}] ${event.content}`);
}
```

#### Advanced Example with Web Crawling
```typescript
import { runAllAIAgentExamples } from '../examples/aiAgentExample';

// Run comprehensive examples
await runAllAIAgentExamples();
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Browser Compatibility
The AI Agent has been specifically designed for browser environments:
- Uses `import.meta.env` for environment variables (Vite-compatible)
- Removes Node.js-specific APIs like `child_process`
- Implements mock web crawling for demonstration purposes
- Uses RxJS Observables for reactive programming

### Key Components

#### AIAgent Class
- **Initialization**: Sets up Anthropic client and MCP server manager
- **Task Execution**: Processes user queries and streams responses
- **Event System**: Emits typed events for different stages of processing

#### MCP Server Manager
- **Server Registration**: Manages external service configurations
- **Mock Implementation**: Provides browser-compatible simulation of server commands
- **Extensible**: Can be enhanced to connect to actual backend services

#### Event Types
- `thinking` - AI is processing the request
- `tool_use` - AI is using external tools (e.g., web crawling)
- `response` - AI is providing the main response
- `error` - An error occurred during processing
- `complete` - Task completed successfully

## üîí Security Considerations

### API Key Safety
- Environment variables with `VITE_` prefix are exposed to the browser
- Only use API keys that are safe for client-side usage
- Consider implementing a backend proxy for production environments
- Never commit real API keys to version control

### Production Recommendations
1. **Backend Proxy**: Implement a backend service to handle AI API calls
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. **Authentication**: Ensure only authenticated users can access AI features
4. **Monitoring**: Log and monitor AI usage for cost control

## üß™ Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the test script to verify setup:
```bash
node test-ai-agent.cjs
```

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to `/ai-assistant` in your browser
2. Try asking a question about medication management
3. Verify that responses stream in real-time
4. Check browser console for any errors

### Build Verification
```bash
npm run build
```
Ensure the build completes without errors.

## üöÄ Deployment

The AI Agent is fully integrated and ready for deployment:
- All TypeScript compilation issues resolved
- Browser-compatible implementation
- Production build tested and working
- Navigation and routing properly configured

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to actual web crawling services
2. **Context Awareness**: Integrate with MediTrack inventory data
3. **Personalization**: Customize responses based on user preferences
4. **Multi-language Support**: Add internationalization
5. **Voice Interface**: Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech
6. **Advanced Analytics**: Track usage patterns and optimize responses

### Integration Opportunities
- **Inventory Insights**: Analyze medication stock levels and provide recommendations
- **Expiry Alerts**: AI-powered notifications for expiring medications
- **Drug Interaction Checking**: Real-time interaction warnings
- **Compliance Monitoring**: AI-assisted adherence tracking

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that environment variables are properly set
2. Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
3. Review browser console for error messages
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
